### Reflection

Few areas that could be further enhanced for an improved gaming experience:

1. Limit rate of missile fire so it would require some accuracy hitting invaders.
2. Add a pause of 3 seconds when the invader reaches the base and make the tank blink (indicating death) so the user can look at his failure better ðŸ˜ˆ.
3. Increase invade rate as time goes by. Display a level number with each invade rate increment. Start the gameplay with 'Level 1'.
